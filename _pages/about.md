I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Apple. 

I completed my Ph.D. at Stanford University advised by [Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/) in the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.stanford.edu/). I completed my B.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University.

My research interests encompass machine learning, robotics, trajectory optimization, and optimal control, all with the goal of building autonomous intelligent systems on Earth and in space.

In my free time, I enjoy dancing, playing board games with friends, and going hiking in sunny California.
